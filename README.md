# GitManage

GitManage is a elegant and simple solution for those who are just learning about
how to use git. By default, git commands are convoluded and difficult to 
decipher. This project seeks to make git into an english-esque language
that is easy and convenient. 

Gitmanage translates your commands into the git language and shows exactly
which operations are being performed and makes learning git easy and fun!
